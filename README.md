### Commit details

In this commit we use redix ui to make the modal. 

We show our modal in layout before the navbar.
This modalProvider has an Modal component. Which gets some props. 
{isOpen,onChange,title,description,children}.

After giving that props to the Modal component we use redix to make the modal.
So, it looks better. Check Modal.tsx to find how the modal component we make.
